Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `<kirby-page-top-content>` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `<kirby-page>`, and it would render its contents within the `<ion-content>` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- <kirby-page-top-content> not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple <kirby-page-top-content> tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky. This is not in scope for now.\\r\\n   \n",

Remove the `NOT Tech Refined` label.--&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Is your enhancement request related to a problem? Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `&lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt;` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `&lt;kirby-page&gt;`, and it would render its contents within the `&lt;ion-content&gt;` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky. This is not in scope for now.\\r\\n</td>\n",

Please describe.**\\r\\nThis may simply be me failing to understand how rules (and specifically **and**) works. It may even be that this is simply not possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI would like my MX Anytime 3 to be able to use the **Smart Shift** button and the **Forward button** as follows:\\r\\n* When individually pressed, Forward = Forward, SS=SS (so divert both, make a rule for each to do what they'd do anyway)\\r\\n* When both pressed to produce the **Super_L** keystroke. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nI have made a rule for each button individually to do what they'd when not diverted. This works.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I make a rule like this: \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n- And:\\r\\n  - Key: Smart Shift\\r\\n  - Key: Forward Button\\r\\n- KeyPress: Super_L\\r\\n...\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doesn't work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nApologies if this is merely an issue of poor understanding of how rules work on my end. Any info how to improve it would be also appreciated. Thanks.\\r\\n   \n",

Please describe.**\\r\\nThis may simply be me failing to understand how rules (and specifically **and**) works. It may even be that this is simply not possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI would like my MX Anytime 3 to be able to use the **Smart Shift** button and the **Forward button** as follows:\\r\\n* When individually pressed, Forward = Forward, SS=SS (so divert both, make a rule for each to do what they'd do anyway)\\r\\n* When both pressed to produce the **Super_L** keystroke. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nI have made a rule for each button individually to do what they'd when not diverted. This works.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I make a rule like this: \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n- And:\\r\\n  - Key: Smart Shift\\r\\n  - Key: Forward Button\\r\\n- KeyPress: Super_L\\r\\n...\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doesn't work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nApologies if this is merely an issue of poor understanding of how rules work on my end. Any info how to improve it would be also appreciated. Thanks.\\r\\n</td>\n",

Please describe.**\\r\\nThis may simply be me failing to understand how rules (and specifically **and**) works. It may even be that this is simply not possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI would like my MX Anytime 3 to be able to use the **Smart Shift** button and the **Forward button** as follows:\\r\\n* When individually pressed, Forward = Forward, SS=SS (so divert both, make a rule for each to do what they'd do anyway)\\r\\n* When both pressed to produce the **Super_L** keystroke. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nI have made a rule for each button individually to do what they'd when not diverted. This works.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I make a rule like this: \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n- And:\\r\\n  - Key: Smart Shift\\r\\n  - Key: Forward Button\\r\\n- KeyPress: Super_L\\r\\n...\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doesn't work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nApologies if this is merely an issue of poor understanding of how rules work on my end. Any info how to improve it would be also appreciated. Thanks.\\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_body\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"information please update to solaar from this repository before asking for a new feature. solaar version solaar version and git describe tags 1.0.4 git1275 8fccd84 202102090518 ubuntu20.10.1 distribution kernel version ex. uname srmo linux 5.8.0 7642 generic x86_64 gnu linux output of solaar show for the target device if applicable unifying receiver device path dev hidraw2 usb id 046d c52b serial 15c89611 firmware 12.10.b0032 bootloader 02.15 other aa.aa has 2 paired function out of a maximum of 6. notifications wireless software present 0x000900 device activity counters 2 64 3 207 2 mx master 3 wireless mouse device path dev hidraw6 wpid 4082 codename mx master 3 kind mouse protocol hid 4.5 polling rate 8 ms 125hz serial number 6c2d4897 model id b02340820000 unit id 6c2d4897 bootloader bot 95.01.b0015 firmware mpm 19.01.b0015 other the power switch is located on the base. supports 35 hid 2.0 features 0 root 0000 1 feature set 0001 2 device fw version 0003 firmware bootloader bot 95.01.b0015 00006a9ca89d firmware firmware mpm 19.01.b0015 40826a9ca89d firmware other unit\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"time 2021-02-15T14:09:09Z author NONE repo pwr-Solaar/Solaar title combination of mouse buttons mx anytime 3 rules body information please update to solaar from this repository before asking for a new feature. solaar version solaar version and git describe tags 1.0.4 git1275 8fccd84 202102090518 ubuntu20.10.1 distribution kernel version ex. uname srmo linux 5.8.0 7642 generic x86_64 gnu linux output of solaar show for the target device if applicable unifying receiver device path dev hidraw2 usb id 046d c52b serial 15c89611 firmware 12.10.b0032 bootloader 02.15 other aa.aa has 2 paired function out of a maximum of 6. notifications wireless software present 0x000900 device activity counters 2 64 3 207 2 mx master 3 wireless mouse device path dev hidraw6 wpid 4082 codename mx master 3 kind mouse protocol hid 4.5 polling rate 8 ms 125hz serial number 6c2d4897 model id b02340820000 unit id 6c2d4897 bootloader bot 95.01.b0015 firmware mpm 19.01.b0015 other the power switch is located on the base. supports 35 hid 2.0 features 0 root 0000 1 feature set 0001 2 device fw version 0003 firmware bootloader bot 95.01.b0015 00006a9ca89d firmware firmware mpm 19.01.b0015 40826a9ca89d firmware other unit\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"issue_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"enhancement\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"roberta_prediction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"enhancement\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llama3_8b_prediction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Classification: Enhancement\\nPrediction Confidence: 90%\\nIssue Understandability: 95%\\n\\nThe issue is about creating a rule that combines the Smart Shift and Forward buttons to produce the Super_L keystroke when both are pressed simultaneously.
